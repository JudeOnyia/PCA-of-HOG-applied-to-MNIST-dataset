# PCA-of-HOG-applied-to-MNIST-dataset
This project involves the development of software to achieve handwritten digit recognition (HWDR)
through machine learning. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used as a multi-class classification
technique applied to the MNIST database of handwritten digits. A preprocessing technique is used to
compute the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) which consists of explicit features that are typically
hidden within an image. This was implemented in MATLAB.

The X1600 file contains the training dataset and corresponding labels used for the PCA model. The Te28
file contains the testing dataset, and the Lte28 file contains the testing labels. These files were
obtained from the MNIST database of handwritten digits.

To demonstrate the project, the main script to run is the Project_Main_Script file, this file uses five
functions available in the same folder as the main script.
